## üöÄ Features at a Glance

| Area | Highlights |
|------|------------|
| Authentication | JWT auth, email OTP verification, BCrypt hashing, role-based access (`ADMIN`, `RIDER`, `CUSTOMER`) |
| Trip Lifecycle | UUID entities, REQUESTED ‚Üí ACCEPTED ‚Üí PICKED_UP ‚Üí IN_TRANSIT ‚Üí DELIVERED, cancellation rules, rider assignment |
| Live Tracking | WebSocket (STOMP) endpoint + Redis cache publisher for future real-time dashboards |
| Reporting | Customer incident reports, admin triage workflow (pending ‚Üí under review ‚Üí resolved) |
| Ratings | One rating per participant per trip, automatic average calculation on `User` and `RiderProfile` |
| Admin Suite | User activation toggles, rider oversight, global view of trips, reports, and ratings |
| Tooling | Global CORS, OpenAPI/Swagger docs, PostgreSQL-ready config, Redis integration, mail placeholders |

## üß± Domain Model (all IDs are UUIDs)

- `User` ‚Äì full name, email, password, phone, role, enabled/verified flags, OTP metadata, aggregated rating
- `RiderProfile` ‚Äì one-to-one with `User`, licensing data, vehicle type, status, total earnings, rating, last known location
- `Trip` ‚Äì references customer & rider, pickup/dropoff, distance, fare, status progression timestamps
- `Payment` ‚Äì one-to-one with trip, amount, method (M-PESA, AIRTEL, TIGO), transaction state, timestamp
- `Report` ‚Äì incident reports linked to trip & reporter with triage status
- `Rating` ‚Äì reviewer/target references with unique constraint per trip to prevent duplicates

---

## üì° Delivery Tracking Hooks

- `WebSocketConfig` exposes `/ws/tracking` (SockJS fallback) with `/topic/trips/{tripId}` subscriptions
- `DeliveryTrackingPublisher` pushes `TripStatusNotification` messages and caches latest status in Redis (`trip-status` hash)
- Designed for dashboards/mobile apps to consume in near real-time

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Access Rules

- `@EnableMethodSecurity` with fine-grained `@PreAuthorize` annotations
- Customers: create trips, cancel pending trips, submit reports, rate riders
- Riders: view/accept available trips, update status through delivery stages, rate customers
- Admins: manage accounts, inspect reports, view system-wide metrics, resolve incidents

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key settings live in `src/main/resources/application.yml` and are environment-variable friendly.

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL:jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dada}
    username: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME:postgres}
    password: ${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD:postgres}
  data:
    redis:
      host: ${SPRING_REDIS_HOST:localhost}
      port: ${SPRING_REDIS_PORT:6379}
  mail:
    username: ${SPRING_MAIL_USERNAME:your-email@example.com}
    password: ${SPRING_MAIL_PASSWORD:change-me}

jwt:
  secret: ${JWT_SECRET:change-me}
  expiration: ${JWT_EXPIRATION:86400000}
```

> **Note:** Update mail and JWT secrets before deploying. Redis is optional but recommended for live tracking.
